### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Adriel

I started my QA career while I was studying to become a developer and had an internship opportunity at a local company, after I started working as a QA I had the opportunity to take my knowledge to a new company and started doing more complex testing work.

Thanks to this and to the people I got to know along the way I found a passion that I didn't know I had for assuring quality.
With this newfound passion I started expanding my skills rather quickly in this, for me, new world. I started working on automating solutions with different frameworks,
webdriverIO and Selenium being the main ones, I'm also working on API testing and contract testing, hopefully I will expand my skills to performance and load testing as well.

Iâ€™m currently learning about Shift Left testing and all that entails, working on new automation testing frameworks (UI, API, Contract, Performance), CICD, among other things.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I always like helping find solutions to issues, I'm also very passionate about learning new things.
