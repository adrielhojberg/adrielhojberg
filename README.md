Hi, I'm Adriel ðŸ‘‹
A Backend Engineer passionate about building the strong, reliable foundations that power great applications.

With two years of dedicated backend experience, I've focused on implementing scalable APIs, managing databases, and ensuring systems are both efficient and secure. My roots in QA have given me a unique, quality-first mindsetâ€”I believe in building systems that are not just functional, but also resilient and easily testable from the ground up.

I'm currently focused on mastering the fundamentals of backend development, with deep dives into API implementation, PostgreSQL, and the infrastructure concepts behind event-driven architecture.

ðŸ’¬ I'm always open to discussing technology, collaborating on interesting problems, or helping others find solutions.
